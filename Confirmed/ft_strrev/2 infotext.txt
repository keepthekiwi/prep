1. String revers : I need to write a function that reverses a string by modifying it.
Steps:
    1. We need to find the length of the string
    2: Then make length = length -1 (to get the last character in the string)
    3. use another variable i = 0 ,

while (i < len)
{
	tmp = str[i];
	str[i] = str[len];
	str[len] = tmp;
	i++;
	jâ€”;
}

We are replacing first character of the string with last character using a temp variable.
