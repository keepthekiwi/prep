Folders:


All:
Possible tasks, but not confirmed. Maybe they're in, but hopefully not.

Confirmed:
Was already part in an exam. This you have to learn.

Eigener Spielplatz:
It's just my own folder, were I try things out and learn. You can ignore this folder.
(Folder is sorted for "E01" etc. for Easy, "M01" etc. for Medium and "X01" etc. for Hardx)
